# **Automated Robotic Arm for Hole Punching**  

This repository contains the complete codebase for an **automated robotic arm** designed for hole-punching tasks in industrial settings. The system integrates **Arduino-controlled pneumatic mechanisms**, **computer vision with YOLO**, and **robotic inverse kinematics** to automate hole punching in paper and plastic materials.  

## **Project Overview**  

The robotic system consists of:  
- **Arduino** receives angle commands from the Raspberry Pi and contain logic.  
- **Computer vision** for detecting objects for robot arm.  
- **Inverse kinematics** for robotic arm movement.  
- **Camera calibration** for accurate object localization.

## **Installation & Usage**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Arduino**  
Upload `arduino_logic.ino` to your **Arduino** board. This handles pneumatic punching and receives movement commands.  

#### **Prerequisites for Raspberry Pi**  
This project is designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 5** with a compatible **AI camera**. If using other Raspberry Pi models with a camera connector (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+), minor modifications may be needed.  


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup AI camera on Raspberry Pi**  
Install IMX500 Firmware (for AI Camera Users)
To enable AI processing on the camera, install the necessary firmware:
```sudo apt install imx500-all imx500-tools```

This command:

Installs required firmware files for the IMX500 sensor.
- **Adds neural network model firmware files to /usr/share/imx500-models/.**
- **Installs IMX500 post-processing software.**
- **Installs Sony's network model packaging tools.**

Install Required Dependencies.To run the picamera2 application (used for model deployment), install:

```sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-munkres```

Once all dependencies are installed, restart your Raspberry Pi:

```sudo reboot```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£Package and Deploy AI Model to the Camera**  

After obtaining packerOut.zip from the IMX500 conversion process this zip file can be found in computer_vision_block folder , you need to package it into an RPK file for deployment to the AI camera.

Run the following command to convert the zip file into a deployable model file:
```imx500-package -i <path to packerOut.zip> -o <output folder>```
This will generate a network.rpk file inside the specified output folder.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Object Detection on Raspberry Pi**  

Create virtual eniroment in folder that contains ```inverse_kinematic.py```, ```object_detection.py``` ```robot_file.urdf```, ```intrinsics.json``` and ```network.rpk```.

Install all libraries and run this comand:
```python object_detection.py``` 

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Wiring and Connection Guide**

To ensure proper functionality of the robotic arm, **all components must be correctly connected**. The image below provides a **detailed wiring diagram** illustrating how to connect the **Arduino, Raspberry Pi, servos, pneumatic system, and camera**.

#### **Key Connections:**
- **Arduino ‚Üí Servos & Pneumatics:** Controls servo angles and activates the pneumatic punching mechanism.
- **Raspberry Pi ‚Üí Arduino (Serial Communication):** Sends calculated angles and punching commands to the Arduino.
- **Raspberry Pi ‚Üí Camera:** Captures images for object detection and position estimation.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure proper voltage distribution to all components (Arduino, servos, Raspberry Pi, solenoids, stepper).

üîß **Refer to the wiring diagram below for detailed connections.**
